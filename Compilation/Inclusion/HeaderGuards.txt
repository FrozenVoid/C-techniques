A set of preprocessor commands that 
avoid double inclusion of content.
example:

#ifndef HEADER_NAME_INCLUDED
#define HEADER_NAME_INCLUDED
/* Code */
#endif

for functions/macros same technique 
is used as modular 
#ifndef FUNCTION_NAME_DEFINED
#define FUNCTION_NAME_DEFINED
/* function/macro definition */
#endif
