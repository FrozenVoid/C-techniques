Debugging stages:
Determine the process/conditions:
What happens? 
Is it random or not?
What is expected and what occurs in practice?


Simplification/Isolate the location: 
Where it happens? Can it be isolated?
Minimal reproducible case.

Find the root cause:
Why it happens? Tracing the chain of effects.
What underlying conditions cause this?
What assumptions exist at the point?

Fixing the causes:
Can the root cause can be fixed?
How the bug is propogated?

Safeguard future code:
Why the bug manifests?
How to prevent it happenning again?
